# <a href="https://gas-station-rating-analyzer-804516230951.us-west1.run.app/#/">SentimentPulse</a>

<p>This is my project submission for an AI solution competition organized by UNWE</p>

## Summary

<p>SentimentPulse is a web app developed with Google AI Studio, that utilizes Gemini AI to summarize raw reviews data scraped from Google Maps. The analyzed data is then displayed in a structured manner with graphs and pie charts.</p>

## :rocket: Goal

<p>It is designed to be used by business owners or organizations with many shops available on google maps. They can easily get a quick summary and a clear visualization of the shops' rating statistics and customer feedback.</p>
